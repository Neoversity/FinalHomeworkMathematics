# FinalHomeworkMathematics
This homework focuses on predicting sleep quality based on data analysis and the application of machine learning models. The student receives an input data set that they analyze and prepare for modeling in Google Colab. The task is divided into three parts:

Data analysis and preparation:

Analysis of ranges of values, averages and variances, distributions, correlations, detection of missing values ​​and their processing.
Replacing binary characters with 0's and 1's, deleting or modifying data as needed.
Modeling:

Building at least two different regression models to predict the target variable "Sleep efficiency".
Assessing the quality of models using at least two metrics on a test sample or cross-validation.
Analysis of the results:

Construction of graphs comparing actual and predicted data for all models.
Formulation of conclusions regarding model errors and comparison of their quality.
In addition, the student can complete optional tasks that are not taken into account in the evaluation, such as multicollinearity analysis, optimization of model parameters, and feature importance analysis.

In the presentation, which is also part of the assignment, the student must present his results on slides with appropriate sections: introduction, solution (with a detailed description of data analysis, modeling and analysis of results), conclusions and reflection.

The purpose of the task is not only to solve the specific problem of predicting sleep quality, but also to demonstrate an understanding of decision-making methods and a professional approach to data analysis in machine learning.
